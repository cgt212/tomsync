Tomboy Sync Server

Contains the OAuth and API server for tomboy to be able to sync to the web.  

The OAuth library is a slightly modified version found here http://code.google.com/p/oauth-php/

Installation
------------

1) Create a database using mysql, 
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE tomsync;

2) Create a user for the application to access the database:
    mysql> GRANT ALL ON tomsync.* TO username identified by 'password';
    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

3) Create a siteconfig.php file to override the config file for local settings like database settings.

class SiteConfig extends Config {
  // Put options here
}

In Progress
-----------

There is currently no way to view the notes online through a web browser.  The OAuth management 
needs some work too, it is currently just barely good enough to get things working.  As a matter
of fact, the entire web based portion is pretty much just working enough to get the API portion
to work.
